##Magic Bakery

Welcome to Magic Bakery. This was a command line version of the game: "Kim-Joy's Magic Bakery". It is a card game in which you bake items to fulfill orders in order to progress the game. In terms of which files you probably want to look at, the code that I've written should be in src/main/bakery, and in src/main/utils, though in utils, the StringUtils file wasn't written by me, it was written by our lecturers. The game doesn't run, however all the code is fully functional. To use an analogy, I successfully created all the pieces of the puzzle, I just didn't put them together. What I mean by this is that we were given a UML diagram, and I created all of the classes and functions, and they all work correctly, and passed all 817 JUnit tests, I just didn't do the BakeryDriver file as it wasn't tested and we didn't need to do it to get full marks.
