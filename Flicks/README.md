Hi,
Welcome to Flicks.
Unfortunately, due to this software being developed on university servers, it doesn't work outside of the university's network. 
Due to this fact, I can't really put the code in this repos, as it wouldn't run anyways. In addition to that, the API has a limited number of uses due to us using the free version, so it might crash anyways, so I felt it was a better demonstration to put a recording instead.
Please view this video bearing in mind the fact that I was part of the front end team, so I worked on things like creating the pages, integrating the API, doing the formatting using CSS, etc.
