Hello,

Welcome to Deckly.

A bit of background context surrounding this project:

This project was completed during the summer at the end of my first year of university. 
The vision I had was to create a software that allows you to create a deck of flashcards, specifically for learning a language like french or spanish. 
The idea was to have two types of flashcards, an automatic one in which you select a language and the software automatically translates the english into the desired language, creating a two sided flashcard,
and a manual type of flashcard, in which you manually enter the english and the translation to whatever language you desire.
The reason for implementing the manual flashcards, was because of a personal reason, and there's a slightly length explanation for this, so I don't expect you to read all of this, however feel free to if you want.
I was born and raised in England, however I come from Algeria. Specifically, my heritage is Amazigh, and whilst French and Arabic are largely spoken languages in Algeria,
there's a more native language, not just in Algeria, but in a few countries in North Africa, called Tamazight. This language was the language that was spoken in Algeria before
the French and the Arabs came to Algeria, and massively popularised French and Arabic as the main languages, but in the villages of the north of Algeria, Tamazight is still spoken.
Ok, that was a long explanation, but there's a reason for all this. Tamazight is the language that I speak with my family in Algeria, however, being born and raised in England
I never learnt Tamazight. The problem was that Tamazight basically didn't exist on the internet until recently, there weren't really any resources available to learn it, 
nor was it available on services like Google Translate, so there wasn't really any feasible way for me to learn it, as I'm sure is the case with a lot of other lesser known, more cultural languages across the globe.
Hence, the manual feature was implemented to allow me to create a database of vocabulary in Tamazight to help me practice and learn. 
Incidentally, Tamazight became an available language on Google Translate part way through me completing this project, but at that point I had already fully implemented the manual card function, so I didn't see a need to remove it.

Why Python?
Quite simply, of the programming languages I know, I'm strongest in python. It's definitely true that a language like Java would've been a much better fit, 
because python doesn't do especially well when it comes to developing GUIs, it tends to do better in things related to data science, such as data analysis. 
However, whilst I do know other languages like Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#, I just didn't feel I could create an impressive, stand-out project in thos languages. 
Also, I wanted to pack as much of the skills I have learnt over the past year into this project, and I feel like I managed to do that. 
This project showcases GUI skills, Machine learning in the form of Naive Bayes, Networking and encryption principles through my use of sockets and hashlib to create servers and allow secure log ins, and
Database management via sqlite. I did try my best to include OOP into this project too, and whilst I managed to include it in the Mobile version, I just couldn't find a usage for it in the desktop version, everything I tried to do with it worked better without it.
