Hi,

This is what was supposed to be the mobile version of deckly.
Kivy is a python library that allows you to create platform independent GUI applications. I had wanted to port deckly onto platforms other than just windows machines, 
so when I discovered Kivy, it enabled me to do just that.
However, as you can see by the folder name, this is incomplete. I was in the process of remaking deckly using kivy instead of customtkinter, but I ran out of time, as I went back to University, and became really busy again.
The file you want to run to see this incomplete version is main.py. I hope to be able to finish this project in the near future, but with University back in full swing, it's not realistic to say that this will be anytime soon.
