Hello,
Thank you for taking the time to look at my GitHub repository. Here you will find what I feel are my most impressive projects at this time. 
Each folder will contain a project, as well as text files / README files explaining what files to run if you wish to run the software on your device, context about the project itself, etc.
I hope you enjoy looking at my repository.
